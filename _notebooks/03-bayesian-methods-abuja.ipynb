    "training data. The additional assumption of naive Bayes is that features\n",
    "are conditional independent given the class label $y_i$ (and the\n",
    "parameter vector, $\\boldsymbol{ \\theta}$. This is quite a strong\n",
    "assumption. However, it causes the objective function to decompose into\n",
    "parts which can be independently fitted to the different feature\n",
    "vectors, meaning it is very easy to fit the model to large data. It is\n",
    "also clear how we should handle *streaming* data and *missing* data.\n",
    "This means that the model can be run ‘live’, adapting parameters and\n",
    "information as it arrives. Indeed, the model is even capable of dealing\n",
    "with new *features* that might arrive at run time. Such is the strength\n",
    "of the modeling the joint probability density. However, the\n",
    "factorization assumption that allows us to do this efficiently is very\n",
    "strong and may lead to poor decision boundaries in practice."
