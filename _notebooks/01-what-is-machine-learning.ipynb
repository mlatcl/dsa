    "One of Breiman’s ideas for improving predictive performance is known as\n",

    "the predictions of these models. The models are trained on different\n",
    "bootstrap samples (Efron, 1979) and their predictions are aggregated\n",

    "that is ‘just right’ for the amount of data available. Not to simple,\n",
