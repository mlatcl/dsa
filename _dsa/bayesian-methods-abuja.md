title: "Bayesian Methods"
subtitle: Probabilistic Machine Learning
abstract: >
  In this session we review the *probabilistic* approach to machine
  learning. We start with a review of probability, and introduce the
  concepts of probabilistic modelling. We then apply the approach in
  practice to Naive Bayesian classification.

  In this session we review the probabilistic formulation of a
  classification model, reviewing initially maximum likelihood and
  the naive Bayes model.
