session: 3
title: "Probabilistic Machine Learning"
abstract: >
  In this session we review the *probabilistic* approach to machine
  learning. We start with a review of probability, and introduce the
  concepts of probabilistic modelling. We then apply the approach in
  practice to Naive Bayesian classification.

  In this session we review the Bayesian formalism in the context of
  linear models, reviewing initially maximum likelihood and
  introducing basis functions as a way of driving non-linearity in the
  model.
